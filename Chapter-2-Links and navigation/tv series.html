        <p>A gangster family epic set in 1900s England, centering on a gang who sew razor blades in the peaks of their caps, and their fierce boss Tommy Shelby.

             Shelby and his gang, the Peaky Blinders, control the city of Birmingham.

            Birmingham, UK, 1919.
             In the aftermath of WW1, the Shelby family are making a name for themselves as bookmakers, racketeers and gangsters.

        <h2>Reviews (what people think about the show)</h2>
        <p>A review by wo tran on the main page of the tv series in google , this is a 5 star review given by a fan.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Manliest series I ever watched.Such a great fan of Thomas Shelby. I would like to point out that Tommy's love interest, Grace, and their entire relationship, gives you an overall perspective of what is "classy British romance" at it's finest. As for old school, as it gets, this series has everything from thrill, to crime, to drama, to sorrow, to opening up your mind, on a whole new level. Peaky Blinders stands out from the other Gangster series because there is something soothing and peaceful about it. The cinematography is so amazing, it keeps you interested and on the edge, the entire time. It is beautiful because crime and killings are not the only things, it shows. It also shows top class drama, making it all the more interesting.  It's totally a "feel good" series. I feel so glad I watched Peaky Blinders, and after watching so many light American sitcoms and series, when you watch something as intense and as British as this, it's going to actually connect with you, and cause you to think, opening up new perspectives. It's not one of those series you watch to have a good time, have fun and forget it the next day. It's like you actually connect to the characters and feel what they are feeling. It keeps you in the deep. The story's going to stay with you forever. Moving forward, for those who are into British accents, and the British style of living, you guys will fall in love with how well-knitted and beautiful the storyline, the accents, the plot, and the screenplay is. Everything is British about it. Everything. That is one of the biggest factors that contribute to making Peaky Blinders, watchable, time and again, making you binge-watch the entire series. Do watch it guys, it is totally worth it.</li>
